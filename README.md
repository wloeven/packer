# Packer

This repository is derived from [this](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) microsoft repository, there a complete devops agent build is found.
For streamline and maintenance purposes i stripped all things i do not need to be in my packer deployment for custom images.

For now the following packer deployments are in this repo:

|name|purpose|
|--|--|
|[linux](azure-custom-image/linux/)|baseline devops custom image.|
|[windows](azure-custom-image/win/)|baseline devops custom image.|
